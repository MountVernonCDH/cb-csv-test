Mr E. Francis Riggs
Treas.

Dear Sir
Yours of 13th recived, enclosing
the cancelled note $2,800 - paid off by you.
Would you mind putting that voucher with
your files, if it is essential to keep it?

The recent travel has so augmented our
revenue I see no reason why the "further
debt of $500." should continue. To wipe
that out I now enclose ck $500., the interest
can be charged to the balance now in your
hands.

As I may have a surplus at the
end of April and determine to deposit
a 'block' of it with your bank (to credit of
General Account) can you give me Power Atty.
or otherwise arrange it so that I can check
against that account should the Association
need the funds during your absence?

Very truly Yours
Harrison H. Dodge Supt.

Please keep $500. voucher
in your files, when pd.
